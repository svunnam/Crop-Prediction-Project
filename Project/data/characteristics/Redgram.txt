Red gram is an important pulse crop in India. It is also known as Pigeonpea or Arhar or Tur. Red gram is mainly cultivated and consumed in developing countries of the world. This crop is widely grown in India. India is the largest producer and consumer of Red gram in the world. Red gram accounted for about 20 percent of the total pulse production of the country during the year 2000-2001. 

Red gram is a protein rich staple food. It contains about 22 percent protein, which is almost three times that of cereals. Red gram supplies a major share of protein requirement of vegetarian population of the country. Red gram is mainly consumed in the form of split pulse as Dal, which is an essential supplement of cereal based diet. The combination of dal-chawal (pulse-rice) or dal-roti (pulse-wheat bread) is an important ingredient in the average Indian diet. The biological value improves greatly, when wheat or rice is combined with Red gram because of the complementary relationship of the essential amino acids. It is particularly rich in lysine, riboflavin, thiamine, niacin and iron.

 Climate and soil

Red gram (pigeon pea) is less suitable for the tropics. The most favourable temperature range is 18-30ºC. The crop is grown at a wide range of elevation. Red gram can be grown in almost all soil types that are not very poor in lime and are not subjected to waterlogging. Optimum growth and yield are obtained in deep loam soils. Red gram can be grown as mixed crop with groundnut, paddy or tapioca or as a pure crop.

 Plant protection

Pod borer is the main pest. For controlling this, spray the crop with 0.05% Quinalphos suspension at the time of flowering. The blister beetle, Zonabris gregariously feeds on the flowers. Against this, Malathion 10% DP may be applied at the flowering stage.

A) Harvesting care 

       The following care should be taken during harvesting: 

1.      Harvesting should be done timely. Timely harvesting will ensure optimum grain quality and consumer acceptance. 

2.      Harvesting before the crops mature, usually result lower yields, higher proportion of immature seeds, poor grain quality and more chances of disease attack during storage. 

3.      Delay in harvesting of Red gram, results in shattering of pods and other losses caused by birds, rats, insects etc.
 

4.      The best time to harvest the crop is when 80 percent of the pods are fully matured.

5.      If the threshing cannot be done immediately, the harvested materials should be bundled and stacked in a dry place. The stacking should be cubical to facilitate circulation of the air around.

 

6.      Rogue out the admixtures prior to harvesting, it helps in fetching good price in the market.

) Post-harvest care

 

Following preventive measures should be taken to avoid post harvest losses: 

a)                 Harvest timely to reduce losses.

 

b)                 Use proper method of harvesting.

 

c)                  Avoid the losses in threshing and winnowing by adopting modern mechanical methods.

 

d)                 Use improved technique of processing.

 

e)                 Adopt grading for getting remunerative prices inter-alia to avoid financial loss.

 

f)                    Use good packaging materials for storage as well as for transportation i.e. in B-Twill Jute bags or in HDPE bags.

 

g)                 Use proper technique in storage.

 

h)                  Use pest control measures during storage.

 

i)                    Timely and proper handling (loading and unloading) of Red gram with good transportation facilities at farm and market level, reduces the losses. 

j)                    Avoid use of hooks by labour during handling.
