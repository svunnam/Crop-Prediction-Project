Soil and climate
A friable well drained red loamy soil in wet or garden lands under tropical conditions is ideal. It can be grown in regions receiving an annual rainfall of 1500 m.

Season
May-June is suitable

Seed Treatment
 30 tonnes of FYM + 500 kg of VAM as soil application + 10 kg each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria as rhizome treatment/ha. In addition to the above dose application of FeSO4 100 kg/ha + ZnSO4 50 kg/ha + 1 t/ha of composted coir waste can be applied. Enriched manure can be applied in 3 equal splits at 3, 4 and 5 months after planting to alleviate chlorosis in turmeric.

Seeds and sowing
Mother rhizomes are better yielders than finger rhizomes.

Seed rate
1500-2000 kg rhizome/ha

Spacing
The rhizomes are to be dibbled in the sides of ridges, 45 cm apart at 15 cm spacing at a depth of 4 cm.

Manures and manuring
Basal
Incorporate FYM 10 t/ha neem or groundnut cake - 200 kg/ha along with N, P and K at 25, 60 and 18 kg/ha; 30 kg/ha of Fe SO4 and 15 kg ZnSO4. Apply 10 kg/ha each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacterium one month after planting.

Top dressing
N, K at 25 and 18 kg/ha applied on 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days after planting.

ntercultivation
Onion, Coriander and Fenugreek can be planted as intercrop on the sides of the ridges 10 cm apart (250 kg seed Onion/ha). Redgram and Castor can also be planted at wider spacing. Weeding can be done as and when necessary. The plants are earthed up at the time of 2nd and 4th top dressings.

lant protection
Pre planting treatment
The seed rhizomes are dipped in Carbendazim 1 g/lit and Phosalone 35 EC 2 ml/lit or Monocrotophos 36 WSC 1.5 ml/lit for controlling rhizome rot and scales.

Pests
Thrips
Thrips can be controlled by spraying Dimethoate 30 EC or Methyl demeton 25 EC 2 ml/litre.

Rhizome scale
Rhizome scale can be controlled by applying well rotten sheep manure @ 10 t/ha in two splits (once basally and other at earthing up) or Poultry manure in 2 splits followed by drenching Dimethoate 30 EC 2 ml/lit or Phosalone 35 EC 2 ml/lit or Application of Carbofuran 3 G @ 1.5 kg a.i./ha.
Seed rhizomes dipped in Phosalone 35 EC 2ml/lit or Monocrotophos 36 WSC 1.5 ml/lit and then stored.

Nematode
Avoid planting turmeric after Banana or other solanaceous vegetables.  Plant only after taking suitable control measures. Apply Carbofuran 4 kg a.i./ha twice on the third and fifth month after planting the rhizomes.

Diseases
Rhizome rot
Rhizome rot can be controlled by drenching with Bordeaux mixture 1 % or Copper oxychloride 0.25 %. Treat the seed rhizomes with 0.3% Copper oxychloride for 30 min before storage.

Leaf spot
Leaf spot can be controlled by spraying Carbendazim 500 g/ha or Mancozeb 1 kg/ha or Copper oxychloride 1.25 kg/ha.

Harvest
The plants will start lodging in about nine months. Yellowing and drying of leaves are the signs of crop maturity. The rhizomes are picked after digging deeply with mammuttis or digging forks.
