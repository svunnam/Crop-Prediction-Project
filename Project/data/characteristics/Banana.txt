Bananas are of the family Musaceae. Globally, bananas rank fourth after rice, wheat and maize in human consumption; they are grown in 130 countries worldwide, more than any other fruit crop.

Bananas are native to tropical Southeastern Asia but are widely cultivated in tropical regions.

In 15th and 16th century, Portuguese colonists started banana plantations in the Atlantic Islands, Brazil, and western Africa. As late as the Victorian Era, bananas were not widely known in Europe, although they were available via merchant trade.

Virtually all bananas traded internationally are of a single variety, the Cavendish, the genetic roots of which lie in India. Three years ago, New Scientist revealed that the Cavendish crop was threatened by pandemics of diseases such as that caused by the black sigatoka fungus.

Now the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned that wild banana species are rapidly becoming extinct as Indian forests are being destroyed, while many traditional farmers' varieties are also disappearing. It would take a global effort to save the bananas' gene pool.
