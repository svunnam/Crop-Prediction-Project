A friable well drained loamy soil rich in humus with warm and humid conditions with 150 cm of annual rainfall are preferable. This crop is grown as an irrigated crop in humid zones from sea level to an altitude of 1500 metres.

Seed rate
1500 - 1800 kg of rhizome/ha is required.

Spacing
For irrigated crop, ridges are formed 40 cm apart and rhizomes planted at 20 cm spacing.

Manures and Manuring
Basal
FYM 40 t/ha, 50 kg P and 25 kg K/ha.
Top dressing
37.5 kg N and 12.5 kg K/ha each applied on 45th and 90th day.

Aftercultivation
Mulching is done at the time of planting with green leaves. After each top dressing, earth up the plants.

Plant protection
Pests
Shoot borer
Shoot borer can be controlled by spraying Dimethoate 30 EC 2 ml/lit or Phosphamidon 86 WSC 1 ml/lit.

Leaf roller
Leaf roller can be controlled by spraying Carbaryl 50 WP 2 g/ha or Quinalphos 25 EC 2 ml/lit.

Diseases
Soft rot (Pythium sp.)          
Lack of drainage and continued dampness expose the plants to soft rot infection. The disease spreads through the seed rhizomes and soil. Provide adequate drainage facilities and select healthy and disease-free seed rhizomes and pre-treat the seed rhizomes. In the field drench the bed with 2.5 g/lit of Copper oxychloride or 1% Bordeaux mixture or Metalaxyl-mancozeb 4 g/lit. Treat the seed rhizomes with Mancozeb or Copper Oxychloride 3 g/lit or 200 ppm Streptocycline for 30 minutes before storage.

Leaf spot
Leaf spot can be controlled by spraying 1 % Bordeaux mixture or Copper oxychloride 0.25%.

Harvest
The crop can be harvested after 8 - 9 months when leaves start yellowing and drying.

Yield
About 12 - 15 t/ha can be obtained.
